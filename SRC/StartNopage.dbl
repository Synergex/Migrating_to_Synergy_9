; This code compiles under Synergy V8 but not under Synergy V9
;
; Problem:	Earlier compilers would incorrectly allow the period to be omitted
;			from .START compiler directives.
;
;			The V9 compiler correctly detects this invalid syntax and reports
;			an "Invalid program entry at or near {start}" error.
;
; Solution:	Change "start" to ".start"
