; This code compiles under Synergy V8 but not under Synergy V9
;
; Problem:	Earlier compilers would allow any unique abbreviation for various
;			qualifiers to repository include compiler directives.
;
;			The V9 compiler only allows specific pre-defined abbreviations.
;
; Solution:	Change "nopre" to "noprec" or "noprecision"
